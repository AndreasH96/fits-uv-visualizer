# FITS file reconstructor visualizer
A *very* simple app for me to learn more about how UV coverage works for a given FITS file. 

Allows you to load a fits file, select UV points and see how the UV coverage affects the reconstruction of the original image. 

## Example: Single point selected
![single_img](./imgs/single_point_selected.png)

## Example: Multiple points selected
![multipe_img](./imgs/multiple_points_selected.png)

In the example with multiple points selected, we can see that the actual image (point source, nothing fancy) can be somewhat seen from the reconstruction.
